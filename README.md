# [Vercel v0 Project](https://v0.dev) Alpha Testing Sandbox
This repository hosts a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), dedicated as a sandbox for alpha testing of [Vercel's v0 project](https://v0.dev).

Getting Started
To begin, you'll need to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser to view the current state of the project.

Modifications can be made on app/page.tsx. The page will update automatically as you make edits.

This sandbox utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to load and optimize Inter, a custom Google Font, automatically.

Engaging in Alpha Testing
Your engagement in testing, reporting issues, and providing feedback is highly encouraged. This collaborative effort is instrumental in refining the functionalities and features of the v0 project.
